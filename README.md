**Stock Analysis - Refactoring Code to Improve Performance**

# Project Overview and Purpose

The purpose of ths project was to change the approach for analyzing stocks to determine if we could improve run time performance by refactoring our original code.

# Project Results

## Run Time Improvement Results

The performace of the refactored code was 14-15% better than the base code.  Comparative times for the base code and refactored code are shown below.
Rune time for the 2017 Analysis was 0.996 seconds.
